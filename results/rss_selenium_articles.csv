Trump tariffs: US orders from Chinese small businesses on hold,"'This is so hard': The Chinese small businesses brought to a standstill by Trump's tariffs

The BBC's Laura Bicker: ''A number of businesses in limbo'' in China, after US tariffs on imports

""Trump is a crazy man,"" says Lionel Xu, who is surrounded by his company's mosquito repellent kits – many were once best sellers in Walmart stores in the United States. Now those products are sitting in boxes in a warehouse in China and will remain there unless President Donald Trump lifts his 145% tariffs on all Chinese goods bound for the US. ""This is so hard for us,"" he adds. Around half of all products made by his company Sorbo Technology are sold to the US. It is a small company by Chinese standards and has around 400 workers in Zhejiang province. But they are not alone in feeling the pain of this economic war. ""We are worried. What if Trump doesn't change his mind? That will be a dangerous thing for our factory,"" says Mr Xu.

Nearby, Amy is helping to sell ice cream makers at her booth for the Guangdong Sailing Trade Company. Her key buyers, including Walmart, are also in the US. ""We have stopped production already,"" she says. ""All the products are in the warehouse."" It was the same story at nearly every booth in the sprawling Canton Fair in the trading hub of Guangzhou. When the BBC speaks to Mr Xu, he is getting ready to take some Australian buyers to lunch. They have come looking for a bargain and hope to drive down the price. ""We will see,"" he says about the tariffs. He believes Trump will back down. ""Maybe it will get better in one or two months. Maybe, maybe,"" Mr Xu adds with his fingers crossed.

Xiqing Wang/ BBC The US and China have both slapped high tariffs on each other

Last week, President Trump temporarily paused the vast majority of tariffs after global stock markets tumbled, and a sell-off in the US bond market. But he kept the import levies targeted at Chinese goods being shipped to the US. Beijing responded by imposing its own 125% levies on American imports. This has bewildered traders from more than 30,000 businesses who have come to the annual fair to show off their goods in several exhibition halls the size of 200 football pitches. In the homeware section, firms displayed everything from washing machines to tumble dryers, electric toothbrushes to juicers and waffle makers. Buyers come from all over the world to see the products for themselves and make a deal. But the cost of a food mixer or a vacuum cleaner from China with the added tariffs are now too high for most American firms to pass on the cost to their customers. The world's two largest economies have hit an impasse and Chinese goods meant for US households are piling up on factory floors. The effects of this trade war will likely be felt in kitchens and living rooms across America, who will now have to buy these goods at higher prices. China has maintained its defiant stance and has vowed to fight this trade war ""until the end."" It is a tone also used by some at the fair. Hy Vian, who was looking to buy some electric ovens for his firm, waved off the effects of tariffs. ""If they don't want us to export – then let them wait. We already have a domestic market in China, we will give the best products to the Chinese first.""

Xiqing Wang/ BBC Lionel Xu says he and other staff at Sorbo Technology are worried about what happens if Trump does not lift the tariffs on China

China does have a large population of 1.4 billion people and in theory this is a strong domestic market. Chinese policymakers have also been trying to stimulate more growth in a sluggish economy by encouraging consumers to spend. But it is not working. Many of the country's middle classes have invested their savings in buying the family home, only to watch their house prices slump in the last four years. Now they want to save money – not spend it. While China may be better placed to weather the storm than other countries, the reality is that it is still an export driven economy. Last year, exports accounted for around half of the country's economic growth. China also remains the world's factory – with Goldman Sachs estimating that around 10 to 20 million people in China may be working on US-bound exports alone.

Xiqing Wang/ BBC Businesses at the Canton Fair in Guangzhou said they have stopped sending goods to the US

Some of its workers are already feeling the pain. Not far from the Canton Fair, there are warrens of workshops in Guangdong making clothes, shoes and bags. This is the manufacturing hub for companies such as Shein and Temu. Each building houses several factories on several floors where workers will labour for 14 hours a day. On a pavement near some shoe factories, a few workers were squatting down to chat and smoke. ""Things are not going well,"" says one, who was unwilling to give his name. His friend urges him to stop talking. Discussing economic difficulties can be sensitive in China. ""We've had problems since the Covid pandemic, and now there's this trade war. I used to be paid 300-400 yuan ($40-54) a day, and now I will be lucky if I get 100 yuan a day.""

Toby Carvery owner admits cutting down ancient Enfield oak tree,"Ancient oak tree cut down by Toby Carvery

PA Media The oak tree was found cut down on 3 April

The cutting down of an ancient oak in north London was ordered on health and safety grounds by the pub chain that owns Toby Carvery after it was told the tree was dead. The felled oak, estimated to be about 500 years old, was found by council workers at the edge of Whitewebbs Park in Enfield earlier in April. An emergency tree preservation order has now been imposed on what remains of the tree, which is near a Toby Carvery. The tree, with a girth of 6m (20ft), was a nationally significant pedunculate oak listed on the Woodland Trust's ancient tree inventory. A spokesperson for Mitchells & Butlers said: ""We took necessary measures to ensure any legal requirements were met.""

'Done the decent thing'

The pub chain spokesperson added: ""This was an important action to protect our employees and guests as well as the wider general public, to whom we have a duty of care."" Earlier, a Mitchells & Butlers source said the company had ""done the decent thing"" although they apologised to locals who loved the tree. Enfield Council's leader, Ergin Erbil, previously said they were treating the matter as criminal damage and had reported it to the police. The Met Police confirmed it had received a report from the council, but it is understood the force believes there is no evidence of criminality.

Woodland Trust Police confirmed they had received a report of criminal damage to the tree

The spokesperson for Mitchells & Butlers said: ""The tree was cut back after we were advised that it caused a serious health and safety risk. ""Upon further inspection, our specialist arboriculture contractors made the assessment that the split and dead wood posed a serious health and safety risk and advised that the tree was unsafe and should be removed. ""We are grateful to our expert contractors for warning us of this hazard so swiftly, allowing us to act before anyone was harmed.""

Paul Whiteing A local resident took a picture of a cherry-picker operating at the tree

Benny Hawksbee, a member of the Guardians of Whitewebbs group, said ""the tree belonged to Enfield and to our national heritage - I am devastated. ""We have now placed a legal protection [Tree Preservation Order] on the tree and are looking at ways to help it grow back."" Jon Stokes, director of trees, science and research at the Tree Council, said the felling of such a ""magnificent"" tree was shocking. ""Ancient oaks can live up to 1,000 years old and are as precious as our stately homes and castles,"" he said. ""Our nation's green heritage should be valued and protected and we will do everything we can to achieve this.""

PA Media There was outrage when the Sycamore Gap tree in Northumberland was chopped down in 2023

The Woodland Trust's head of campaigning Adam Cormack said: ""This depressing sight is a reminder to all of us that not every ancient tree is in a safe place. ""It is very unusual to see the felling of an oak tree of this size and age. Legally protected status for heritage trees like the Whitewebbs Oak is long overdue."" The trust's Living Legends petition, which aims to secure such status for heritage trees, and which attracted more than 100,000 signatures, was handed in to Downing Street in November.

The issue of tree preservation was highlighted after the destruction of the Sycamore Gap tree in September 2023. There was outrage when the tree, which stood in a dip next to Hadrian's Wall in Northumberland, was chopped down. Daniel Graham, 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, both from Cumbria, are accused of causing criminal damage put at more than £600,000.

Birmingham City Council 'on track' to clear waste backlog,"Birmingham council 'on track' to clear waste backlog

PA The standoff between bin workers and the council has led to bin bags and fly-tipped rubbish piling up on streets

Birmingham City Council says it is on track to clear a backlog of uncollected waste by the weekend, despite the ongoing dispute with the Unite union. Craig Cooper, strategic director of city operations, said collections would focus first on ""the poorest parts"" of the city ""affected the most"" by the ongoing bin strike. Mr Cooper said the amount of uncollected waste had peaked at 22,000 tonnes, but he expected to be back to ""one household collection every week"" for all residents by the weekend. Hundreds of bin workers began an all-out strike on 11 March, in a standoff with the Labour-run council that has led to bin bags and fly-tipped rubbish piling up on streets.

The city's residents are caught in the middle of the dispute, and many have told the BBC of their increasing frustrations, with one saying it ""can't go on"". Striking workers held a rally on Tuesday morning, a day after Unite union members rejected the city council's latest pay offer.

Bin workers belonging to the Unite union remain in a standoff with the council after an all-out strike started on 11 March

""We're already back to collecting normal household waste this week,"" Mr Cooper said. ""We are back into a position of good control. ""The priority now is street cleansing and making sure the fly-tipping is at a manageable level."" He added that the council had 120 bin lorries out every day completing rounds, which was roughly half of its total capacity. Garden waste and recycling will not be collected by the authority until the strike is over, he said. Mr Cooper described it as ""disappointing"" that an agreement had not been reached with Unite and urged them to ""come back to the table"" to end the dispute. More negotiations between the two sides are expected to take place on Wednesday.

The dispute centres around the council's decision to remove Waste Recycling and Collection Officer (WRCO) roles from some bin workers. On Monday, workers voted to reject the council's latest offer, which Unite said was ""totally inadequate"" and also did not address potential pay cuts for 200 drivers. A council spokesperson said the offer was fair and included options for affected workers. But one of them, Jordan McNeill, a mother-of-two who came to Tuesday's rally, said workers were already on a low wage. ""I'm not going to be able to pay my bills, I'm not going to be able to do things for my children,"" said Ms McNeill. ""I'm just going to be living day by day, thinking 'where am I going to get my food from? Where am I going to get everything else from? Where am I going to get my children's clothes from?' ""I don't know what I'm supposed to do.""

Bin worker Jordan McNeill said the cuts would affect her ability to pay her bills

Tuesday's rally took place outside the Council House, home of Birmingham City Council, with dozens of Unite officials, bin workers and supporters attending. There were cheers and loud horns from the crowd, who held up placards and flags. Unite said a petition supporting the striking workers and containing 3,000 signatures was handed in during the event.

Volunteer Haroon Hassan said the bin strike was ""very, very tough"" for residents

Many Brummies have stepped forward to help each other out during the strikes, with neighbours sharing trips to the tip and volunteer litter-pickers seeing their work increase. ""Where we can help people out, we should help out,"" said Haroon Hassan, who was collecting bin bags from residents and carrying them to a mobile waste centre in Small Heath on Tuesday. ""That's just being a good citizen, a good member of the community."" During the strike, the council has been running mobile collections where bin trucks park at a fixed location in a neighbourhood for a morning, so people can bring along their rubbish. Mr Hassan told BBC Radio WM that the bin strike had been ""very, very tough"" for residents, especially with the weather getting warmer in recent weeks. He said he was hopeful the two sides would soon find a solution, as ""this sort of stuff can't go on forever"".

Violet Williams said she felt ""awful"" when she saw photos of bin bags piling up in the city

Violet Williams, a Small Heath resident who was using the waste centre, said she felt ""awful"" when she saw photos of bin bags piling up on the city's streets, which have made headlines around the world. Ms Williams, who does not have a car, was dropping her rubbish off at the centre before taking a bus to collect more rubbish from her 92-year-old mother.

Bin workers at the rally stressed that they were not on strike in order to get a pay rise but in order to protect their existing roles and wages. One of them, Maxine Stanley, said: ""Once they say our wages [will be] left alone, we'll all go back to work. We're all Birmingham residents – my bins haven't been collected. ""But at the end of the day, we've got to stand firm against Birmingham City Council. ""I don't want Birmingham to look like this, I want it to be clean.""

Bin worker Samuel Yates said the strike aimed to protect people's existing wages, not get them a pay rise

""Not one of the people you see standing here wants to be on strike,"" said Samuel Yates, who holds one of the WRCO roles that is at the centre of the dispute. ""We don't want a wage rise; we just want a fair pay for the fair day's work that we do."" Mr Yates said he stood to lose £6,200 per year from his salary on top of a £1,200 wage cut that he had already had to accept. Many workers also said they did not like to see the city's streets in a poor state, but they felt they had to go on strike to protect their livelihoods. ""The majority of us don't just work in Birmingham; we actually live in Birmingham too, so we are Birmingham residents, and we're affected as much as the public are,"" said Steeven Biset.

As the strike rumbles on, national government ministers have also voiced concerns over the situation in the UK's second largest city. ""Our message, loud and clear, is that Unite needs to call off the strike, accept the deal, and let's get back to normal,"" industry minister Sarah Jones told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday. The union said its workers were striking in order to prevent pay cuts, not in a bid to get more money than they currently receive. ""Our members would like nothing better than to be able to call off the strike and get back to work,"" Onay Kasab, Unite national lead officer, told BBC Breakfast. ""But as things stand, we still have people who are going to be facing huge pay cuts as a result of this.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgqvnp88n51o,birmingham council on track to clear waste

Nests and some dead rodents were found in outbuildings of the house where Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife Betsy Arakawa were found dead. New Mexico Department of Public Health records seen by BBC News documented evidence of the animals in eight detached buildings at their home in Santa Fe. US officials previously confirmed that Ms Arakawa, 65, died from a respiratory illness linked to hantavirus, which can be transmitted by infected rodents. It is believed she died a week before her husband, 95, who was in the advanced stages of Alzheimer's disease. Authorities found the deceased couple in their home in February.

An environmental assessment of the property took place on 5 March, a week after they were discovered, as part of the investigation into their deaths. It found rodent faeces, a live rodent, dead rodent and a rodent nest in three garages, in addition to further rodent droppings in two small external houses and three sheds. Traps had also been set up. There were sightings of rodents, a nest and faeces in two abandoned vehicles or farming machinery in the grounds of the property. All eight detached outbuildings were within 50 yards (45 metres) of the main house where the couple lived, which itself was ""clean with no signs of rodent activity,"" New Mexico public health officials said in their eight-page report.
