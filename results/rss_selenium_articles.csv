UK inflation falls as price of petrol drops,"Falling petrol prices push UK inflation down

Falling petrol prices drove UK inflation down by more than expected in the year to March. Inflation was 2.6%, down from a rate of 2.8% in February, according to official data. But the fall may only be temporary as analysts say it's expected to spike from April as rising bills and higher business costs take hold. ""The only significant offset came from the price of clothes which rose strongly this month,"" said Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

The average price of petrol fell by 1.6p per litre between February and March to 137.5p per litre. The inflation decrease was also driven by a drop in recreation and culture prices, with toys, games, and hobbies falling particularly sharply. The fall in inflation means that, although prices continue to rise, the pace is slowing. Price rises have slowed from highs seen in recent years. Wages continue to outpace inflation with salary raises for public sector workers growing more than those in the private sector. The average rise in wages was 5.9%, data released by the ONS on Tuesday showed.

How quickly are prices rising? In May, the inflation figure for April will likely be pushed to around 3% due to increases in gas prices, electricity prices, and water charges, said Michael Saunders, senior advisor at Oxford Economics. The former member of the Bank of England's interest rate setting Monetary Policy Committee told Radio 4's Today Programme the effect of Trump's trade wars will also be felt in exports and investment in the UK. ""We may get a diversion of cheap exports which might have otherwise gone to the US, will start to come to Europe and the UK,"" he said. ""Perhaps not as high as the Bank of England had feared a few months ago, but the economy will be weaker, with exports and investment and consumer spending all hit and unemployment starting to rise"". He added that another side-effect of Trump's trade war is hitting global growth, which causes oil prices to fall, which will feed through to lower petrol prices here in the UK.

'It's getting higher and higher'

Sonja Skelton says the biggest cost for her business is staffing - and that's about to get higher with minimum wage increases. The recent increase in National Insurance has cost her over £60,000. ""And it's getting higher and higher,"" she says, but she adds she's happy to pay as she says it will help to improve the UK's infrastructure. Her firm, West Special Fasteners, makes nuts and bolts, and has been doing since 1999. The firm has over 65 employees and supplies offshore defence and specialist construction firms with non-standard fasteners, made with stainless steel and exotic metals. ""We're trying to be a little bit more efficient, so we're trying to improve all our processes, because that can help claw some of that money back."" But, she adds, if she isn't able to absorb extra costs, the prices of her products will have to go up. ""So there's a specialist material we call that's called Hastelloy C-276. I'd probably say around five years ago, that might have been, say, £30 per kilo. ""We're now looking at around about £50 per kilo. So, as you can tell, it's a massive, massive increase"". As her firm is a high energy user, the rising cost of energy has also ""really impacted"" her. On top of that, she says that working in engineering, ""you always have ups and downs, because it really depends what's happening all over the world, and conflicts can have a knock-on effect on what we do"".

Interest rate cut

As inflation comes down, it could put pressure on the Bank of England to cut its key interest rate, currently 4.5%. Vacancies at their lowest point in four years and economic pressure predicted from Donald Trump's tariffs may also encourage the Bank to cut when it meets next month. But the Bank faces a dilemma, as wage growth remains strong and this would normally discourage a cut in rates.

Disposable vape use falling in UK ahead of government ban,"Disposable vape use falling in UK ahead of ban

Getty Images Disposable vapes will no longer be available for sale after 1 June 2025 due to a government ban in the UK

The popularity of disposable e-cigarettes or vapes has fallen ahead of a UK-wide ban on their sale on 1 June, a study suggests. The percentage of people aged 16-24 who mainly use disposable vapes has dropped by nearly half in the last year from 63% to 35%, University College London (UCL) researchers say. But researchers believe vape users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes in anticipation of the ban – instead of giving up. As a result they warn the ban may only have a ""limited impact"" on vaping rates as it found vaping in general stalled between January 2024 and 2025 in all adults over 16 after several years of significant growth.

Getty Images Refillable vapes (top) differ from single use vapes (bottom) as they can be recharged and refilled with vape liquid.

The UK government ban on disposable and single-use vapes is aimed at stopping littering as, in most cases, the vapes cannot be recycled and often end up in landfill or pollute natural environments. The ban is also aimed at tackling rising rates of youth vaping and protecting children from harm. GP Dr Helen Wall told BBC Breakfast that NHS advice is ""very clear"" that vaping should be used as a means to stop smoking. ""But for people who have never smoked, and for young people particularly, to turn to vaping can be quite detrimental,"" she said. ""Our young people are becoming quite addicted. It's affecting their concentration, they're becoming agitated, their capacity to learn is affected, their developing brain can be affected."" The UCL study looked at survey data on vaping habits in England, Wales and Scotland both before and after the ban was announced. The study used data from the Smoking Toolkit Study, which collected data on 88,611 people aged 16 and over. Before the ban, between January 2022 and January 2024, vaping among those aged 16 and over went up from 8.9% to 13.5%. In young adults aged 16-24, usage increased more sharply, from 17% to 26.5%. After the ban was announced, researchers found a decline in the number of vapers mainly using disposable e-cigarettes - in all age groups and particularly among 16-24 year olds. The study only asked vape users about their main choice of device. Dr Sarah Jackson, who works for the UCL Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group and is the lead author of the survey, tells the BBC she thinks ""more people are turning to refillable, reusable devices"" rather than stopping vaping altogether. ""We often see people change their behaviour in response to impending policy changes before they come into action,"" she adds. Disposable vapes are single-use devices, which come pre-filled with vape liquid, whereas refillable and rechargeable (reusable) devices have a longer shelf-life and are often a cheaper way to vape in the long-term. A reusable vape has vape liquid that can be refilled and a battery that can be recharged.

Dr Jackson adds that vape manufacturers have also been quick to react to the upcoming ban, with ""the most popular"" disposable brands producing rechargeable versions of their most popular models. ""They're very similar in design, colours, flavours and even price,"" she says. While Dr Jackson thinks it's too early to tell whether the government's new strategy will deter young people from vaping, she maintains that health legislators face ""an issue of balance"". ""We know it makes sense to do something to try and reduce the vast numbers of young people taking up vaping, but the key public health priority here does remain smoking,"" she says. ""This is vastly more harmful and is killing a lot of people every year, so we need to make sure that any policy measures that are brought in to tackle youth vaping don't put people off using vapes, which are very effective at quitting smoking,"" she adds.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kxzylvvvvo,disposable vape use falling in uk ahead of ban hours ago share save annabel rackham health reporter share save getty images disposable vapes will no longer be available for sale after june due to a government ban in the uk the popularity of disposable ecigarettes or vapes has fallen ahead of a ukwide ban on their sale on june a study suggests the percentage of people aged who mainly use disposable vapes has dropped by nearly half in the last year from to university college london ucl researchers say but researchers believe vape users are switching to refillable and rechargeable vapes in anticipation of the ban instead of giving up as a result they warn the ban may only have a limited impact on vaping rates as it found vaping in general stalled between january and in all adults over after several years of significant growth getty images refillable vapes top differ from single use vapes bottom as they can be recharged and refilled with vape liquid the uk government ban on disposable and singleuse vapes is aimed at stopping littering as in most cases the vapes cannot be recycled and often end up in landfill or pollute natural environments the ban is also aimed at tackling rising rates of youth vaping and protecting children from harm gp dr helen wall told bbc breakfast that nhs advice is very clear that vaping should be used as a means to stop smoking but for people who have never smoked and for young people particularly to turn to vaping can be quite detrimental she said our young people are becoming quite addicted its affecting their concentration theyre becoming agitated their capacity to learn is affected their developing brain can be affected the ucl study looked at survey data on vaping habits in england wales and scotland both before and after the ban was announced the study used data from the smoking toolkit study which collected data on people aged and over before the ban between january and january vaping among those aged and over went up from to in young adults aged usage increased more sharply from to after the ban was announced researchers found a decline in the number of vapers mainly using disposable ecigarettes in all age groups and particularly among year olds the study only asked vape users about their main choice of device dr sarah jackson who works for the ucl tobacco and alcohol research group and is the lead author of the survey tells the bbc she thinks more people are turning to refillable reusable devices rather than stopping vaping altogether we often see people change their behaviour in response to impending policy changes before they come into action she adds disposable vapes are singleuse devices which come prefilled with vape liquid whereas refillable and rechargeable reusable devices have a longer shelflife and are often a cheaper way to vape in the longterm a reusable vape has vape liquid that can be refilled and a battery that can be recharged dr jackson adds that vape manufacturers have also been quick to react to the upcoming ban with the most popular disposable brands producing rechargeable versions of their most popular models theyre very similar in design colours flavours and even price she says while dr jackson thinks its too early to tell whether the governments new strategy will deter young people from vaping she maintains that health legislators face an issue of balance we know it makes sense to do something to try and reduce the vast numbers of young people taking up vaping but the key public health priority here does remain smoking she says this is vastly more harmful and is killing a lot of people every year so we need to make sure that any policy measures that are brought in to tackle youth vaping dont put people off using vapes which are very effective at quitting smoking she adds,Fake,69.0,31.0
Prison unit where Manchester Arena bomber Hashem Abedi attacked guards emptied,"Prison unit emptied after Manchester bomber attack

Greater Manchester Police Hashem Abedi left prison officers at HMP Frankland in hospital with serious injuries following an attack on Saturday

All prisoners held in the terrorism prison unit where Manchester Arena bomber Hashem Abedi attacked guards have been moved, the BBC has been told. There were seven prisoners in the HMP Frankland separation centre at the time of Abedi's attack on Saturday, including the extremist preacher Anjem Choudary. The centre has now been emptied and is the subject of an ongoing counter-terrorism investigation into the attack, which saw Abedi throw hot oil at officers and stab them with improvised blades. Abedi himself has been moved to London's high-security Belmarsh prison, while the other six prisoners in have been moved to HMP Woodhill, a source told the BBC.

The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has said there will be a full, independent review into the incident, which has drawn criticism from survivors and the families of victims of the Manchester Arena bombing. Martin Hibbert, a survivor of the 2017 attack, criticised how Abedi was given the ""comfort and privilege"" of kitchen facilities and said he was furious the pain of survivors was being so ""blatantly disrespected"". Abedi, who helped his older brother Salman plan the Manchester Arena bombing, was jailed for life with a minimum 55 years in prison after being convicted of murdering 22 people. Mr Hibbert was paralysed from the waist down in the blast and his daughter Eve left severely disabled. In an open letter to Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood, Mr Hibbert said: ""Let's call this what it is: a catastrophic failure of your duty to protect prison staff and the public from an unrepentant terrorist. ""Not only was Abedi allowed the freedom to move around and use facilities that should never be available to someone like him - he was able to track and target three prison guards using boiling oil and homemade weapons. ""I was led to believe that people like him - mass murderers, terrorists - would face a regime of strict control and zero comfort. I was told justice would be served. ""What I see now is not justice. It's a shameful lack of accountability and basic prison security.""

PA Media Martin Hibbert said he was ""absolutely disgusted"" Abedi was given kitchen access

Abedi had been held in a separation centre - which holds a small number of inmates deemed to be dangerous and extremist - at Frankland. He moved to Frankland after carrying out an earlier attack on prison officers in Belmarsh prison in 2020, for which three years and 10 months was added to his sentence. Two prison officers remain in hospital with serious injuries from the latest attack, while a third has been discharged. ""I'm not just angry. I'm broken by this,"" Mr Hibbert added. ""And I am furious that the pain of survivors like me is being so blatantly disrespected by your inaction. ""This cannot continue. Something drastic needs to be done. Not tomorrow. Not next month. Now. ""Review his prison privileges. Strip him of any access to areas where he can make or find weapons. Protect your staff. Protect the memory of those we lost. Respect those who survived. ""Because right now, it feels like you've forgotten us.""

PA Media Abedi is held in high-security HMP Frankland prison in County Durham

Mr Hibbert's letter comes a day after families of five people murdered in the Arena bombing told the justice secretary of their ""absolute disbelief"" over the HMP Frankland attack. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman has said it was ""clear that something went terribly wrong"" with how Abedi had been handled. A MoJ spokesperson said: ""Our thoughts remain with the victims of the Manchester Arena bombing and their families who are understandably concerned by the shocking attack at HMP Frankland this weekend. ""We've already taken immediate action to suspend access to kitchens in separation and close supervision centres. ""We will also launch a full independent review into how this attack was able to happen and will set out the terms and scope of this review in the coming days.""",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5qe6j01g6o,prison unit emptied after manchester bomber attack minutes ago share save daniel de simone investigations correspondent tom symonds bbc news share save greater manchester police hashem abedi left prison officers at hmp frankland in hospital with serious injuries following an attack on saturday all prisoners held in the terrorism prison unit where manchester arena bomber hashem abedi attacked guards have been moved the bbc has been told there were seven prisoners in the hmp frankland separation centre at the time of abedis attack on saturday including the extremist preacher anjem choudary the centre has now been emptied and is the subject of an ongoing counterterrorism investigation into the attack which saw abedi throw hot oil at officers and stab them with improvised blades abedi himself has been moved to londons highsecurity belmarsh prison while the other six prisoners in have been moved to hmp woodhill a source told the bbc the ministry of justice moj has said there will be a full independent review into the incident which has drawn criticism from survivors and the families of victims of the manchester arena bombing martin hibbert a survivor of the attack criticised how abedi was given the comfort and privilege of kitchen facilities and said he was furious the pain of survivors was being so blatantly disrespected abedi who helped his older brother salman plan the manchester arena bombing was jailed for life with a minimum years in prison after being convicted of murdering people mr hibbert was paralysed from the waist down in the blast and his daughter eve left severely disabled in an open letter to justice secretary shabana mahmood mr hibbert said lets call this what it is a catastrophic failure of your duty to protect prison staff and the public from an unrepentant terrorist not only was abedi allowed the freedom to move around and use facilities that should never be available to someone like him he was able to track and target three prison guards using boiling oil and homemade weapons i was led to believe that people like him mass murderers terrorists would face a regime of strict control and zero comfort i was told justice would be served what i see now is not justice its a shameful lack of accountability and basic prison security pa media martin hibbert said he was absolutely disgusted abedi was given kitchen access abedi had been held in a separation centre which holds a small number of inmates deemed to be dangerous and extremist at frankland he moved to frankland after carrying out an earlier attack on prison officers in belmarsh prison in for which three years and months was added to his sentence two prison officers remain in hospital with serious injuries from the latest attack while a third has been discharged im not just angry im broken by this mr hibbert added and i am furious that the pain of survivors like me is being so blatantly disrespected by your inaction this cannot continue something drastic needs to be done not tomorrow not next month now review his prison privileges strip him of any access to areas where he can make or find weapons protect your staff protect the memory of those we lost respect those who survived because right now it feels like youve forgotten us pa media abedi is held in highsecurity hmp frankland prison in county durham mr hibberts letter comes a day after families of five people murdered in the arena bombing told the justice secretary of their absolute disbelief over the hmp frankland attack prime minister sir keir starmers spokesman has said it was clear that something went terribly wrong with how abedi had been handled a moj spokesperson said our thoughts remain with the victims of the manchester arena bombing and their families who are understandably concerned by the shocking attack at hmp frankland this weekend weve already taken immediate action to suspend access to kitchens in separation and close supervision centres we will also launch a full independent review into how this attack was able to happen and will set out the terms and scope of this review in the coming days,Real,49.0,51.0
Nvidia expects $5.5bn hit as US tightens chip export rules to China,"Nvidia expects $5.5bn hit as US tightens chip export rules to China

The rules come amid an escalating trade war between the US and China, with both countries introducing steep trade tariffs on each other covering various goods.

The firm, which has been at the heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, will require licences to export its H20 AI chip to China, which has been one of its most popular.

Computer chip giant Nvidia says it will be hit with $5.5bn (£4.2bn) in costs after the US government tightened export rules to China.

Nvidia announced on Tuesday that the US government had told it last week that the H20 chip required a permit to be sold to China, including Hong Kong.

The tech giant said federal officials had advised them the licence requirement ""will be in effect for the indefinite future"".

""The [government] indicated that the license requirement addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in, or diverted to, a supercomputer in China,"" Nvidia said.

The company declined to comment further when contacted by the BBC.

Marc Einstein from the Counterpoint Research consultancy said the $5.5bn hit estimated by Nvidia was in line with his estimates.

""While this is certainly a lot of money, this is something Nvidia can bear,"" he said.

""But as we have seen in the last few days and weeks, this may largely be a negotiating tactic. I wouldn't be surprised to see some exemptions or changes made to tariff policy in the near future, given this not only impacts Nvidia but the entire US semiconductor ecosystem,"" Mr Einstein added.

Chips remain a battleground in the US-China race for tech supremacy, and US President Donald Trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect.

Nvidia's AI chips have been a key focus of US export controls. Founded in 1993, it was originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics, particularly for computer games.

Long before the AI revolution, it started adding features to its chips that it says help machine learning. It is now seen as a key company to watch to see how fast AI-powered tech is spreading across the business world.

The company's value took a hit in January when it was reported that a rival Chinese AI app, DeepSeek, had been built at a fraction of the cost of other chatbots.

At the time, the US was considered to have been caught off guard by their rival's technological achievement.

Nvidia said its $5.5bn charges would be associated with H20 products for inventory, purchase commitments and related reserves.

Rui Ma, founder of the Tech Buzz China podcast, said she expects the US and China AI semiconductor supply chains to be ""fully decoupled"" if restrictions stay in place.

She added: ""It doesn't make any sense for any Chinese customer to be dependent on US chips"" especially since there is an oversupply of data centres in China.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2xzn6jmzpo,nvidia expects bn hit as us tightens chip export rules to china the rules come amid an escalating trade war between the us and china with both countries introducing steep trade tariffs on each other covering various goods the firm which has been at the heart of the artificial intelligence ai boom will require licences to export its h ai chip to china which has been one of its most popular computer chip giant nvidia says it will be hit with bn bn in costs after the us government tightened export rules to china nvidia announced on tuesday that the us government had told it last week that the h chip required a permit to be sold to china including hong kong the tech giant said federal officials had advised them the licence requirement will be in effect for the indefinite future the government indicated that the license requirement addresses the risk that the covered products may be used in or diverted to a supercomputer in china nvidia said the company declined to comment further when contacted by the bbc marc einstein from the counterpoint research consultancy said the bn hit estimated by nvidia was in line with his estimates while this is certainly a lot of money this is something nvidia can bear he said but as we have seen in the last few days and weeks this may largely be a negotiating tactic i wouldnt be surprised to see some exemptions or changes made to tariff policy in the near future given this not only impacts nvidia but the entire us semiconductor ecosystem mr einstein added chips remain a battleground in the uschina race for tech supremacy and us president donald trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect nvidias ai chips have been a key focus of us export controls founded in it was originally known for making the type of computer chips that process graphics particularly for computer games long before the ai revolution it started adding features to its chips that it says help machine learning it is now seen as a key company to watch to see how fast aipowered tech is spreading across the business world the companys value took a hit in january when it was reported that a rival chinese ai app deepseek had been built at a fraction of the cost of other chatbots at the time the us was considered to have been caught off guard by their rivals technological achievement nvidia said its bn charges would be associated with h products for inventory purchase commitments and related reserves rui ma founder of the tech buzz china podcast said she expects the us and china ai semiconductor supply chains to be fully decoupled if restrictions stay in place she added it doesnt make any sense for any chinese customer to be dependent on us chips especially since there is an oversupply of data centres in china,Real,49.0,51.0
Tariffs fallout: The US will struggle to take on Asia over chips,"Trump's chips strategy: The US will struggle to take on Asia

BBC

Listen to this article The US has ""dropped the ball"" on chip manufacturing over the years, allowing China and other Asian hubs to steam ahead. So said Gina Raimondo, who at the time was the US Commerce Secretary, in an interview with me back in 2021. Four years on, chips remain a battleground in the US-China race for tech supremacy, and US President Donald Trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect. He says his tariff policy will liberate the US economy and bring jobs home, but it is also the case that some of the biggest companies have long struggled with a lack of skilled workers and poor-quality products in their American factories. So what will Trump do differently? And, given that Taiwan and other parts of Asia have the secret sauce on creating high-precision chips, is it even possible for the US to produce them too, and at scale?

Microchips: The secret sauce

Semiconductors are central to powering everything from washing machines to iPhones, and military jets to electric vehicles. These tiny wafers of silicon, known as chips, were invented in the United States, but today, it is in Asia that the most advanced chips are being produced at phenomenal scale. Making them is expensive and technologically complex. An iPhone for example may contain chips that were designed in the US, manufactured in Taiwan, Japan or South Korea, using raw materials like rare earths which are mostly mined in China. Next they may be sent to Vietnam for packaging, then to China for assembly and testing, before being shipped to the US.

It is a deeply integrated ecosystem, one that has evolved over the decades. Trump has praised the chip industry but also threatened it with tariffs. He has told industry leader, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), it would have to pay a tax of 100% if it did not build factories in the US. With such a complex ecosystem, and fierce competition, they need to be able to plan for higher costs and investment calls in the long term, well beyond Trump's administration. The constant changes to policies aren't helping. So far, some have shown a willingness to invest in the US. The significant subsidies that China, Taiwan, Japan and South Korea have given to private companies developing chips are a big reason for their success. That was largely the thinking behind the US Chips and Science Act, which became law in 2022 under President Joe Biden – an effort to re-shore the manufacture of chips and diversify supply chains - by allocating grants, tax credits, and subsidies to incentivise domestic manufacturing.

Getty Images Donald Trump has threatened TSMC with a tax of 100% if it does not build factories in the US

Some companies like the world's largest chipmaker TSMC and the world's largest smartphone maker Samsung have become major beneficiaries of the legislation, with TSMC receiving $6.6 billion in grants and loans for plants in Arizona, and Samsung receiving an estimated $6 billion for a facility in Taylor, Texas. TSMC announced a further $100 billion investment into the US with Trump, on top of $65 billion pledged for three plants. Diversifying chip production works for TSMC too, with China repeatedly threatening to take control of the island. But both TSMC and Samsung have faced challenges with their investments, including surging costs, difficulty recruiting skilled labour, construction delays and resistance from local unions. ""This isn't just a factory where you make boxes,"" says Marc Einstein, research director at market intelligence firm Counterpoint. ""The factories that make chips are such high-tech sterile environments, they take years and years to build."" And despite the US investment, TSMC has said that most of its manufacturing will remain in Taiwan, especially its most advanced computer chips.

Did China try to steal Taiwan's prowess?

Today, TSMC's plants in Arizona produce high-quality chips. But Chris Miller, author of Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology, argues that ""they're a generation behind the cutting edge in Taiwan"". ""The question of scale depends on how much investment is made in the US versus Taiwan,"" he says. ""Today, Taiwan has far more capacity."" The reality is, it took decades for Taiwan to build up that capacity, and despite the threat of China spending billions to steal Taiwan's prowess in the industry, it continues to thrive.

Getty Images TSMC has invested in chip manufacturing in America

TSMC was the pioneer of the ""foundry model"" where chip makers took US designs and manufactured chips for other companies. Riding on a wave of Silicon Valley start-ups like Apple, Qualcomm and Intel, TSMC was able to compete with US and Japanese giants with the best engineers, highly skilled labour and knowledge sharing. ""Could the US make chips and create jobs?"" asks Mr Einstein. ""Sure, but are they going to get chips down to a nanometre? Probably not."" One reason is Trump's immigration policy, which can potentially limit the arrival of skilled talent from China and India. ""Even Elon Musk has had an immigration problem with Tesla engineers,"" says Mr Einstein, referring to Musk's support for the US's H-1B visa programme that brings skilled workers to the US. ""That's a bottleneck and there's nothing they can do, unless they change their stance on immigration entirely. You can't just magic PhDs out of nowhere.""

The global knock-on effect

Even so, Trump has doubled down on tariffs, ordering a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector. ""It's a wrench in the machine – a big wrench,"" says Mr Einstein. ""Japan for example was basing its economic revitalisation on semiconductors and tariffs were not in the business plan."" The longer-term impact on the industry, according to Mr Miller, is likely to be a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing in many of the world's key economies: China, Europe, the US. Some companies could look for new markets. Chinese technology giant Huawei, for example, expanded into Europe and emerging markets including Thailand, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and many countries in Africa in the face of export controls and tariffs, although the margins in developing nations are small. ""China ultimately will want to win – it has to innovate and invest in R&D. Look at what it did with Deepseek,"" says Mr Einstein, referring to the China-built AI chatbot. ""If they build better chips, everyone is going to go to them. Cost-effectiveness is something they can do now, and looking forward, it's the ultra-high-tech fabrication.""

Trump says his tariff policy will liberate the US economy and bring jobs home

In the meantime, new manufacturing hubs may emerge. India has a lot of promise, according to experts who say there is more chance of it becoming integrated into the chip supply chain than the US – it's geographically closer, labour is cheap and education is good. India has signalled a willingness that it is open to chip manufacturing, but it faces a number of challenges, including land acquisition for factories, and water – chip production needs the highest quality water and a lot of it.

Bargaining chips

Chip companies are not completely at the mercy of tariffs. The sheer reliance and demand for chips from major US companies like Microsoft, Apple and Cisco could apply pressure on Trump to reverse any levies on the chip sector. Some insiders believe intense lobbying by Apple CEO Tim Cook secured the exemptions to smartphone, laptop and electronic tariffs, and Trump reportedly lifted a ban on the chips Nvidia can sell to China as a result of lobbying. Asked specifically about Apple products on Monday in the Oval Office, Trump said, ""I'm a very flexible person,"" adding that ""there will be maybe things coming up, I speak to Tim Cook, I helped Tim Cook recently.""

Mr Einstein thinks it all comes down to Trump ultimately trying to make a deal - he and his administration know they can't just build a bigger building when it comes to chips. ""I think what the Trump administration is trying to do is what it has done with TikTok's owner Bytedance. He is saying I'm not going to let you operate in the US anymore unless you give Oracle or another US company a stake,"" says Mr Einstein. ""I think they're trying to fandangle something similar here – TSMC isn't going anywhere, let's just force them to do a deal with Intel and take a slice of the pie."" But the blueprint of the Asia semiconductor ecosystem has a valuable lesson: no one country can operate a chip industry on its own, and if you want to make advanced semiconductors, efficiently and at scale – it will take time. Trump is trying to create a chip industry through protectionism and isolation, when what allowed the chip industry to emerge throughout Asia is the opposite: collaboration in a globalised economy.",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9ljwgg9y0o,trumps chips strategy the us will struggle to take on asia hours ago share save suranjana tewari reporting from singapore share save bbc listen to this article the us has dropped the ball on chip manufacturing over the years allowing china and other asian hubs to steam ahead so said gina raimondo who at the time was the us commerce secretary in an interview with me back in four years on chips remain a battleground in the uschina race for tech supremacy and us president donald trump now wants to turbocharge a highly complex and delicate manufacturing process that has taken other regions decades to perfect he says his tariff policy will liberate the us economy and bring jobs home but it is also the case that some of the biggest companies have long struggled with a lack of skilled workers and poorquality products in their american factories so what will trump do differently and given that taiwan and other parts of asia have the secret sauce on creating highprecision chips is it even possible for the us to produce them too and at scale microchips the secret sauce semiconductors are central to powering everything from washing machines to iphones and military jets to electric vehicles these tiny wafers of silicon known as chips were invented in the united states but today it is in asia that the most advanced chips are being produced at phenomenal scale making them is expensive and technologically complex an iphone for example may contain chips that were designed in the us manufactured in taiwan japan or south korea using raw materials like rare earths which are mostly mined in china next they may be sent to vietnam for packaging then to china for assembly and testing before being shipped to the us getty images microchips were invented in the us but asian countries now dominates production it is a deeply integrated ecosystem one that has evolved over the decades trump has praised the chip industry but also threatened it with tariffs he has told industry leader taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc it would have to pay a tax of if it did not build factories in the us with such a complex ecosystem and fierce competition they need to be able to plan for higher costs and investment calls in the long term well beyond trumps administration the constant changes to policies arent helping so far some have shown a willingness to invest in the us the significant subsidies that china taiwan japan and south korea have given to private companies developing chips are a big reason for their success that was largely the thinking behind the us chips and science act which became law in under president joe biden an effort to reshore the manufacture of chips and diversify supply chains by allocating grants tax credits and subsidies to incentivise domestic manufacturing getty images donald trump has threatened tsmc with a tax of if it does not build factories in the us some companies like the worlds largest chipmaker tsmc and the worlds largest smartphone maker samsung have become major beneficiaries of the legislation with tsmc receiving billion in grants and loans for plants in arizona and samsung receiving an estimated billion for a facility in taylor texas tsmc announced a further billion investment into the us with trump on top of billion pledged for three plants diversifying chip production works for tsmc too with china repeatedly threatening to take control of the island but both tsmc and samsung have faced challenges with their investments including surging costs difficulty recruiting skilled labour construction delays and resistance from local unions this isnt just a factory where you make boxes says marc einstein research director at market intelligence firm counterpoint the factories that make chips are such hightech sterile environments they take years and years to build and despite the us investment tsmc has said that most of its manufacturing will remain in taiwan especially its most advanced computer chips did china try to steal taiwans prowess today tsmcs plants in arizona produce highquality chips but chris miller author of chip war the fight for the worlds most critical technology argues that theyre a generation behind the cutting edge in taiwan the question of scale depends on how much investment is made in the us versus taiwan he says today taiwan has far more capacity the reality is it took decades for taiwan to build up that capacity and despite the threat of china spending billions to steal taiwans prowess in the industry it continues to thrive getty images tsmc has invested in chip manufacturing in america tsmc was the pioneer of the foundry model where chip makers took us designs and manufactured chips for other companies riding on a wave of silicon valley startups like apple qualcomm and intel tsmc was able to compete with us and japanese giants with the best engineers highly skilled labour and knowledge sharing could the us make chips and create jobs asks mr einstein sure but are they going to get chips down to a nanometre probably not one reason is trumps immigration policy which can potentially limit the arrival of skilled talent from china and india even elon musk has had an immigration problem with tesla engineers says mr einstein referring to musks support for the uss hb visa programme that brings skilled workers to the us thats a bottleneck and theres nothing they can do unless they change their stance on immigration entirely you cant just magic phds out of nowhere the global knockon effect even so trump has doubled down on tariffs ordering a national security trade investigation into the semiconductor sector its a wrench in the machine a big wrench says mr einstein japan for example was basing its economic revitalisation on semiconductors and tariffs were not in the business plan the longerterm impact on the industry according to mr miller is likely to be a renewed focus on domestic manufacturing in many of the worlds key economies china europe the us some companies could look for new markets chinese technology giant huawei for example expanded into europe and emerging markets including thailand the uae saudi arabia malaysia and many countries in africa in the face of export controls and tariffs although the margins in developing nations are small china ultimately will want to win it has to innovate and invest in rd look at what it did with deepseek says mr einstein referring to the chinabuilt ai chatbot if they build better chips everyone is going to go to them costeffectiveness is something they can do now and looking forward its the ultrahightech fabrication trump says his tariff policy will liberate the us economy and bring jobs home in the meantime new manufacturing hubs may emerge india has a lot of promise according to experts who say there is more chance of it becoming integrated into the chip supply chain than the us its geographically closer labour is cheap and education is good india has signalled a willingness that it is open to chip manufacturing but it faces a number of challenges including land acquisition for factories and water chip production needs the highest quality water and a lot of it bargaining chips chip companies are not completely at the mercy of tariffs the sheer reliance and demand for chips from major us companies like microsoft apple and cisco could apply pressure on trump to reverse any levies on the chip sector some insiders believe intense lobbying by apple ceo tim cook secured the exemptions to smartphone laptop and electronic tariffs and trump reportedly lifted a ban on the chips nvidia can sell to china as a result of lobbying asked specifically about apple products on monday in the oval office trump said im a very flexible person adding that there will be maybe things coming up i speak to tim cook i helped tim cook recently getty images nvidia ceo
